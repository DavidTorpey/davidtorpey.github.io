Labelled data is often either expensive or hard to obtain. As such, there has been a plethora of work to make better use of unlabelled data in machine learning, with paradigms such as unsupervised learning, semi-supervised learning, and more recently, self-supervised learning. FixMatch is an approach to semi-supervised learning (SSL) that combines two common approaches of SSL: 1. consistency regularisation and pseudo-labelling.

## Consistency Regularisation

Consistency regularisation is an approach that utilises unlabelled data, and its core assumption is: *the model should output similar predictions when fed perturbed versions of the same input sample*. Formally, what this means is that given a model $$ f $$ and input sample $$ x $$, $$ f(x) = f(a(x)) $$ for some perturbation function $$ a $$.
