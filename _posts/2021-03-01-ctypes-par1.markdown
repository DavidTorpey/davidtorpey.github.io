The purpose of this tutorial is to demonstrate how one can interface with C or
C++ code using the `ctypes` standard library of Python. Some reasons you may one to do this include:

1. Using a 3rd-party library or SDK that is implemented in C or C++.
1. Speed or performance improves from implementing an algorithm or part of the system/program in C or C++.
1. Easy way to extend Python code to C or C++.
