Here is some of the formal research I have done or been part of **academically** (not in industry):

## Human action recognition using local two-stream CNN features with SVMs

This research paper is finding a novel algorithm to solve human action recognition, and is a result of my MSc. research. The proposed approach includes using two-stream 3D CNNs trained separately on RGB and optical flow inputs. A linear SVM is then used to classify actions, trained on a joint representations inferred from the two networks. The paper is currently with the editors at Elsevier Pattern Recognition Letters.

## Masters of Science

My MSc. Computer Science research involved finding a novel algorithm to human action recognition. Earlier in the degree, I conducted research into steganography; machine learning on homomorphically-encrypted data; and image compression using autoencoders and JPEG2000.

## Automated Parking Detection

This research was my Honours year project in university. I gathered the data manually. I performed an investigation of multiple potential real-time techniques for automated parking detection. These included neural networks, Viola-Jones cascade, and a simple RGB-based multivariate Gaussian approach.
