Here is some of the formal research I have done or been part of **academically** (not in industry):

## Masters of Science

My MSc. Computer Science research involved finding a novel algorithm to human action recognition. Earlier in the degree, I conducted research into steganography; machine learning on homomorphically-encrypted data; and image compression using autoencoders and JPEG2000.

## Automated Parking Detection

This research was my Honours year project in university. I gathered the data manually. I performed an investigation of multiple potential real-time techniques for automated parking detection. These included neural networks, Viola-Jones cascade, and a simple RGB-based multivariate Gaussian approach.
