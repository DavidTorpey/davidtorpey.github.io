This page is meant to give you a quickstart guide to some of the research papers and resources I find most helpful when learning different concepts, ideas, algorithms, and techniques in machine learning and computer vision. I highly recommend reading them if you are doing research in those fields, or just out of morbid curiosity!


## [Robust Real-time Object Detection](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~efros/courses/LBMV07/Papers/viola-IJCV-01.pdf)
This introduces one of the most interesting and clever algorithms for performing real-time face detection (although it can be generalized to any object class). It was one of my first exposures to the computer vision field. The algorithm was so successful that it is still used today in many smartphones to perform the face detection in the camera.
