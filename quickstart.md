This page is meant to give you a quickstart guide to some of the research papers and resources I find most helpful when learning different concepts, ideas, algorithms, and techniques in machine learning and computer vision. I highly recommend reading them if you are doing research in those fields, or just out of morbid curiosity!


## [Robust Real-time Object Detection](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~efros/courses/LBMV07/Papers/viola-IJCV-01.pdf)

## [Distinctive Image Features from Scale-Invariant Keypoints](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~malik/cs294/lowe-ijcv04.pdf)
