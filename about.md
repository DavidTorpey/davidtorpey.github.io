I am a computer scientist. I have been doing machine learning and computer vision research for years, and am thus an avid fan. Therefore, this blog will provide a much-needed outlet for me to express and share my ideas and learnings in the fields. I may perhaps delve into other interests of mine as well.

Research Interests:

- Computer vision
- Representation learning
- Unsupervised learning
- Semi-supervised learning
