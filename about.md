I am a computer scientist. I have been doing machine learning and computer vision research for years, and am thus
an avid fan. Therefore, this blog will provide a much-needed outlet for me to express and share my ideas and learnings in the fields. I may perhaps delve into other interests of mine as well.

You can find my CV [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pgD0GU6s2PV-wyxAJ-xCVYYZH523uRTXMj3KCCpgh0c/edit?usp=sharing).
